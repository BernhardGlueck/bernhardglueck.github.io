Thanks to the new WPF based GUI of Visual Studio 2010 there are some noticeable cosmetic improvements.
Most of you might already know this, but the text editor supports arbitrary zooming now.
Simply hold down your CTRL key and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
Thanks to the much improved text rendering support in WPF
( ClearType and sophisticated hardware anti aliasing using shaders ) the results are quite gorgeous in my opinion
and make for great presentations on large displays or projector screens:

The theme i am using is Vibrant Ink by the way, a quite natural port of the same theme from TextMate.
