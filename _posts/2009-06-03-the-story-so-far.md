Today I launched my new blog. The last few years have been quite a ride and many things have happened,
both personally and professionally. My friends probably know what I am talking about on the personal front,
but everything is on the up and up again, and I am looking forward to a productive 2009.
Professionally since I am currently working on a long term contract for an Austrian company,
my partner and I have closed down our consulting business simply because there is no time left to tackle any
other projects right now. Of course I am still a 100 % geek, and thus you will hopefully find regular updates about
things I play with in my little spare time here.
